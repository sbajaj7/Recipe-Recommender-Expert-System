# Recipe-Recommender-Expert-System
Recipe Recommender is an expert system, which could be used by people of different age groups to receive recommendations about different recipes.

It recommends the user a set of recipes that he/she can cook based on the ingredients that are available to the user.
Since this system is a prototype, so there is an assumption that basic ingredients such as salt, chili, pepper, vegetable oil, etc are available to the user.

In this expert system, I am categorizing the Recipe Recommendation in 3 categories:

1. Starter 		
2. Main Course		
3. Desert

This allow the user to choose the kind of recipe that he/she wants to cook in a broader perspective.
According to his/her response the name of the recipe is displayed. 
Also, the step by step Method of preparation along with a Youtube Video Link for the recipe is also displayed.
